## Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator  (Toy Problem)

The "Student Grade Generator" is a JavaScript function that calculates and assigns grades to student marks based on predefined criteria. Users are prompted to input student marks (between 0 and 100), and the function determines the corresponding grade (A, B, C, D, or E) as follows:

A: Greater than 79
B: 60 to 79
C: 50 to 59
D: 40 to 49
E: Less than 40

## Usage 
Call the calculateGrade function and provide a student's mark as an argument.
The function validates the input and calculates the grade.
The calculated grade is displayed in the console.
