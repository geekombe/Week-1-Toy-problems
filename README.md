## Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator 

- The "Student Grade Generator" is a JavaScript function that calculates and assigns grades to student marks based on predefined criteria. Users are prompted to input student marks (between 0 and 100), and the function determines the corresponding grade (A, B, C, D, or E) as follows:

A: Greater than 79
B: 60 to 79
C: 50 to 59
D: 40 to 49
E: Less than 40

## Usage 
- Call the calculateGrade function and provide a student's mark as an argument.
- The function validates the input and calculates the grade.
- The calculated grade is displayed in the console.


## Challenge 2: Speed Detector 
- Given the speed of a car as argument, the function evaluates whether the car is exceeding the speed limit and calculates the corresponding demerit points based on the following rules:

- If the car's speed is less than or equal to 70 km/h, it prints "Ok," indicating compliance with the speed limit.
- For every 5 km/h above the speed limit (70 km/h), the function assigns one demerit point to the driver and prints the total number of demerit points.
- If the driver accumulates 12 or more demerit points, the function prints "License suspended."

## usage 
- Call the speedDetector function and provide speed as an argument.
- The function evaluates whether the car is exceeding the speed limit and calculates the corresponding demerit points.
- If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points


## Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator 
This JavaScript program calculates an individual's net salary by inputting their basic salary and benefits. It computes PAYE (Tax), NHIF Deductions, NSSF Deductions, gross salary, and net salary, ensuring compliance with Kenyan tax and insurance regulations.

## Usage
- Call the calculateNetSalary()function and provide basicSalary and benefits as arguments.
- The function calculates Payee, NHIF Deduction, NSSF Deduction and Net Salary.
- The calculated Payee, NHIF Deduction, NSSF Deduction and Net Salary are displayed in the console.
